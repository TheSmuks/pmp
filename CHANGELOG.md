# Changelog

All notable changes to pmp are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `remove` command — remove a dependency (uninstall + delete from pike.json + update lockfile)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — standard contributing guide
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-triggered release workflow

### Changed
- **Breaking:** Rewrote `bin/pmp` from POSIX sh to native Pike (`bin/pmp.pike`)
  - No longer requires curl, tar, sha256sum — uses Pike's native `Protocols.HTTP`, `Standards.JSON`, `Crypto.SHA256`, `Filesystem.Tar`
  - `bin/pmp` is now a shim that delegates to `bin/pmp.pike`, sets `PIKE_MODULE_PATH`
  - JSON parsing is now native (was sed-based)
  - `pmp env` resolves local dependencies at generation time instead of runtime
- **Refactor:** Decomposed monolithic `pmp.pike` (~1700 lines) into modular `Pmp.pmod/` library
  - 9 stateless modules: Config, Helpers, Source, Http, Resolve, Store, Lockfile, Manifest, Validate
  - Entry point `pmp.pike` (~480 lines) holds mutable state and command dispatch
  - All pure functions extracted to modules; state passed as explicit parameters
  - `store_install_*` return result mappings instead of setting globals
  - `lockfile_add_entry` returns new array (Pike arrays are immutable on `+=`)
- `.github/workflows/docs-check.yml` — removed `continue-on-error: true` (docs must be consistent)

### Fixed
- **Manifest validation: comment/string stripping** — `import` statements inside `//` comments, `/* */` block comments, and `"string literals"` no longer produce false warnings
- **Manifest validation: `inherit` scanning** — `inherit Foo;` and `inherit Foo.Bar;` are now detected alongside `import Foo;`
- **Manifest validation: `#include` scanning** — `#include <Foo.pmod/bar.h>` is now recognized as a dependency indicator
- **Manifest validation: dynamic std_libs** — standard library modules are discovered from the running Pike installation instead of a hardcoded list of 32 entries
- **Manifest validation: directory recursion** — nested directories (not just `.pmod`-suffixed) are now scanned for `.pike` and `.pmod` files
- **`add_to_manifest`: false positive fix** — no longer uses raw string search; checks `data->dependencies[name]` via JSON decode to avoid false positives when the name appears in other fields like `"name"`
- `cmd_env()` now includes local path dependencies (`./` and `/` prefixed) in the generated `.pike-env/bin/pike` wrapper
## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — full architecture document with diagrams, data flow, and extension points
- `RELEASE.md` — release process documentation with pre-release checklist
- `lock` command — resolve dependencies and write lockfile without installing
- `env` command — create `.pike-env/` virtual environment with `bin/pike` wrapper and `activate` script
- `run` command — execute scripts with `PIKE_MODULE_PATH` set to installed modules
- Transitive dependency resolution with cycle detection via `_VISITED`
- Manifest validation — warns on undeclared imports in installed packages
- Self-hosted git source type support
- Content-addressable store with `.pmp-meta` metadata files
- Documentation sync protocol across AGENTS.md, SKILL.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md
- CI doc-sync workflow (`.github/workflows/docs-check.yml`)
- `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking notable changes
- Conventional commit conventions documented in AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
